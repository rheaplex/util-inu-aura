# UTIL / INU / AURA

UTIL: Utilitarian "utils" - a measure of value for utility functions.

INU: A measure of inutility - the waste, denial, or absence of utility.

AURA: The aura of art - its presence, cultural cachet, or specialness.

# Notes

Uses code from https://github.com/tokenbound/contracts .

This is a static next.js app. It is built using `missingSuspenseWithCSRBailout`
because `/aura/` needs to access the url search params.
